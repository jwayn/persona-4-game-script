# persona-4-game-script
A slightly interactive game script for Persona 4.

This tool was created to make it easier and more entertaining for students of Japanese to search through the Persona 4 game script.

## Running Locally
To run, simply open `index.html`.
There is no build system, no libraries, no server necessary. Everything is done client-side, and the script is included in the JS.

To test AnkiConnect, you must have anki running and AnkiConnect installed.
